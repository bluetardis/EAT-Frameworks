 ## Note For OS X Users
OS X Desktop does not support 'adaptive' scaling which is crucial to allowing dynamic window resizing (without re-scaling).

While I work out a solution to this, I will be building two fixed resolution builds for OSX in these folders:
 * OSX/ - 1778 x 1000 (should fit on a 1920 x 1080 and larger sized monitor.)
 * OSX_SmallScreen/ - 1200 x 675 (should fit on a 1200 x 800 resolution MacBook monitor.)
